### What's up ‚úåüèø

My name is Darren and I'm a Computer Science major at New York University with a passion for backend software development and data science. I have experience with various programming languages and frameworks such as Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, Flask, and [Hikari](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari), as well as working with Microsoft Azure's cloud tools. I'm currently exploring some learning models for data analysis on my [current project](https://github.com/Scriptize/Cluster_Analysis_Project) and some Javascript on the side to start building fullstack web applications.

I've had the opportunity to work with industry-leading firms such as [Stratacy Consulting Group](https://stratacy.com/) and [Balyasny Asset Management](https://www.bamfunds.com/), where I gained valuable experience in financial research and software engineering, specifically compliance and trading technologies.

In addition to my work, I'm also a student Tech Opionion Contributor for [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/news/opinion?mod=wsjheader_logo)  the co-founder and Lead Developer of [Limbless Devs](https://limbless.vercel.app/), a project development team aimed at making technical concepts more accessible to students with less technical backgrounds. Our first project involves utilizing a clustering algorithm to find correlations between large datasets sourced online. I've also built a [discord bot that can automate giveaways](https://github.com/Scriptize/Robux-Rain) through ROBLOX's Groups and Auth API endpoints. Soon I'm looking forward to create either a "framework" or clone of the platform itself ü§î.

My ultimate goal as an engineer is to become a problem solver that develops and innovates technologies that keep networks of communities interconnected. Through my work, I aim to develop and innovate technologies that foster greater connectivity and facilitate the growth of communities. Whether it's building tools that enable collaboration and communication or developing systems that enable better information sharing and knowledge dissemination, I believe that technology has the potential to transform the way we connect and interact with each other.

By working towards this goal, I hope to contribute to a world where communities are empowered to solve problems and create positive change, and where networking is not just a means of advancing one's career, but a way of building meaningful relationships and supporting each other's growth.
